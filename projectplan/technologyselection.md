# Technology Selection

***The Classics*** is an online storefront dedicated to selling vintage vinyl records. Our goal is to create a seamless and engaging shopping experience for collectors and enthusiasts. To achieve this, we have carefully selected a technology stack that balances performance, scalability, and maintainability while aligning with **current industry standards and future growth considerations**.  

Our team collaborates through [**Microsoft Teams**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/), manages source control with [**GitHub**](https://github.com/), and documents progress with [**Loom**](https://www.loom.com/), ensuring a streamlined and professional workflow. Below, we detail our technology selections and their roles in our project.  

---

### Programming Language:

- [**C#**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
  - *Industry-Standard Choice*: C# is one of the most widely used programming languages in enterprise development, ensuring strong community support and long-term viability.
  - *Future-Focused*: With continuous updates from Microsoft and strong cross-platform capabilities, C# remains a relevant and evolving language for modern web applications. 
  - *Integration Benefits*: Seamlessly integrates with .NET technologies, making it an ideal choice for a scalable and maintainable web application.  

### Web Framework:

- [**ASP.NET Blazor**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/)
  - *Modern Approach*: Blazor Server allows us to build interactive web applications using **C# on both the client and server**, reducing reliance on JavaScript frameworks.
  - *Performance and Security*: The server-side rendering model ensures **faster initial load times** and keeps sensitive logic on the server, enhancing security.
  - *Future Scalability*: As our project grows, we have the option to transition to **Blazor WebAssembly** or hybrid cloud-based models, keeping our platform adaptable to future trends.    

### Database & Storage:

- **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)**
  - *Lean and Efficient*: Perfect for small to medium-sized applications without the overhead of a full database server. 
  - *Scalability Considerations*: While SQLite meets our current needs, it provides an easy migration path to more robust database solutions such as PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server as our storefront expands. 
  - *Industry Relevance*: Many major applications use SQLite for local data storage and caching, demonstrating its reliability and industry acceptance.
