# Team 8 - The Classics



Welcome to our team repository, created for our class project for SWE 3313. All possible documentation will be added here as the project is developed and will ultimately lead to a finished product ready for use.

As for the project itself, the ***Classics*** team is creating an online storefront to sell vintage vinyls of various musical genres with the use of C# and ASP.NET Core Blazor. Walk with us as we learn about the intricacies of developing and managing solutions for our clients.
