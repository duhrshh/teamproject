# Team 8 - The Classics



Welcome to our team repository, created for our class project for SWE 3313. All possible documentation will be added here as the project is developed and will ultimately lead to a finished product ready for use.

As for the project itself, the ***Classics*** team is creating an online storefront to sell vintage vinyls of various musical genres with the use of C# and ASP.NET Core Blazor. Walk with us as we learn about the intricacies of developing and managing solutions for our clients.

## Project Plan

Once we gathered, certain discussions were started in order to create an effective plan that would result in a proper product.

#### Team Assignments

- In order to maximize efficiency throughout the project, we assigned certain roles to each contributor:
  - [Project Manager](/projectplan/projectmanager.md) (Darsh)
  - [Front-End Developer](/projectplan/frontend.md) (Chris)
  - [Back-End Developer](/projectplan/backend.md) (Josiah)

#### Technology Selection

- In order to familiarize ourselves with industry-standard tools, we chose to code the project using C# through an ASP.NET Blazor server. To store our data, we utilized an SQLite database. Microsoft Teams was also used to ensure effective communication throughout the length of the project.

## Requirements

After a lengthy conversation with our customer, we were able to capture their required functionalities, features, and processes necessary for the project to be deemed successful.

In summary, we defined functionality for an online vinyl store that supports account creation, inventory browsing, and secure checkout. Users can register, log in, add unique one-off vinyl records to their cart, and complete purchases using validated payment and shipping information. Admins have extended privileges, including promoting users, managing inventory, and accessing sales reports. The system ensures price accuracy, excludes sold items from listings, and provides high-fidelity UI mockups and receipt displays for clarity and consistency.

The detailed requirements that were elicited from the aforementioned conversation are detailed [here](/requirements/requirementswritten.md).
